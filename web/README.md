### Development

This project uses [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
so you will need to use yarn.

- Run `yarn install` in the **root directory**, this will link the `web` project
  with the `cli` project as well.
- Run `yarn serve` to serve a development version which reloads and rebuilds as you make changes.
- Build the project (for production) with `yarn build`
