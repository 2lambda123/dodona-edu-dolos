# Try Dolos

Try out a demonstration of a real report generated by Dolos, generated using
the files present in the [SOCO dataset](https://pan.webis.de/fire14/pan14-web/soco.html).

The input of Dolos were enhanced by adding [labels](/guide/import.html#Labels)
indicating whether a file is involved in plagiarism (orange) or not (blue).

If you want to run Dolos yourself, you can follow our [quick start guide](/guide/installation.html)
