## What's in a name?

Dolos is properly named after the spirit of trickery and guile in Greek
mythology. He became known for his skill when attempting to make a fraudulent
copy statue of Aletheia , in order to trick people into thinking they were
seeing the real statue. He ran out of the clay he was using to create the
statue, and had to leave the feet unfinished as he quaked in fear while his
skill-master looked over his attempt at deceitfulness. To his surprise,
Prometheus was rather amazed at the similarity between the statues, so Dolos
then became a master in cunning deception, craftiness, and treachery. There are
even some stories of Dolos tricking gods into lies.
