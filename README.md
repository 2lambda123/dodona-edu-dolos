# Dolos

Plagiarism detection for programming assignments.

Dolos supports all languages for which a [tree-sitter grammar](https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages?q=tree-sitter-) exists.
The parsers for Bash, C#, Java, JavaScript and Python are included out of the box, but Dolos will pick up other parsers which are installed in the runtime environment.

Read the [Dodona tutorial](./Dodona.md) for a guide on how to use Dolos for analyzing [Dodona](https://dodona.ugent.be) submissions.

See [Dolos-CLI](./cli) for more information about the Dolos project.
