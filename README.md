# Dolos

Plagiarism detection for computer programming assignments.

Right now, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript and Python are officially supported. Additional languages for which a [tree-sitter grammar](https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages?q=tree-sitter-) is available might also work.

See [Dolos-CLI](./cli) for more information about the Dolos project.
